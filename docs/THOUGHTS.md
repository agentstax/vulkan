look into AGPLv3 liscense

we need a long 1hr repeatable live test:
- spins up db, multi producer and multi consumers (built images)
- producers are variadic - zero load, low load, high load, ddos territory
- produces report at end of system - failed produces, skipped (dropped) messages, retries
- We can build on this overtime but keep it relatively simple at start
- Might make sense to roll this into bench as a correctness or reliability benchmark

need another review to make sure we are not logging any sensitive information like payload

At end we should put up roadmap as github issues to get liked etc
