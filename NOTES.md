# NOTES

The real deliverable of the learning plan. One entry per phase:
*"System X does this by ___, and the tradeoff is ___"* plus the
Explain-it-back answers, written from memory.

## Phase 1 — The durable atom: append + atomic claim

**What it does, and the tradeoff:** a Postgres-backed queue makes durability and
exactly-one-worker-gets-each-message fall out of a single transaction:
claim → process → delete → commit. The claim (`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`)
locks the row until the transaction ends; the `DELETE` removes it; the `COMMIT`
makes both permanent atomically. The tradeoff is that the row is held for the
*entire* duration of processing — a slow handler holds its lock (and a DB
connection) the whole time. That's fine at this scale and is the thing Phase 2
fixes by moving the "I'm working on this" claim out of the DB lock and into row
*data* (`status` + `locked_at`).

**The aha:** a crashed worker needs zero recovery code. The transaction rollback
*is* the recovery — Postgres releases the lock and the row is claimable again.
`SKIP LOCKED` is what lets two workers run the same claim query at the same
instant and get *different* rows instead of one blocking the other.

### Explain it back

**1. Why must the `DELETE` be in the same transaction as the claim? Walk both
orderings if it's separate.**

Because a separate delete is unsafe in *both* possible orderings:
- **Delete after processing (separate tx):** the work finishes, then the delete
  has a network blip / crash before committing → the row is still there → it gets
  claimed and processed *again*. Duplicate work.
- **Delete before processing (separate tx):** the row is gone, then the worker
  crashes mid-process → the work is lost forever and never completed. Worst case.

Same-transaction delete risks neither: either the commit lands (processed AND
deleted) or it doesn't (nothing happened, row still claimable). Atomicity is the
whole durability story of this phase.

**2. A worker is `kill -9`'d mid-process. What does Postgres do, and when is the
row claimable again?**

The connection drops with an open, uncommitted transaction. Postgres treats that
as a failed transaction and rolls it back, which releases the `FOR UPDATE` lock.
The row is claimable again as soon as the rollback completes — another consumer's
`SKIP LOCKED` query will see it on the next poll.

**3. What does `SKIP LOCKED` change about the result set, and why is skipping safe
here when it would normally be a correctness bug?**

It removes already-locked rows from the result set instead of blocking on them. A
locked row is "in process" by another worker, so skipping it is exactly what we
want — skipping prevents double-processing rather than dropping work. (The work
isn't lost; it's just owned by someone else right now.)

### Done

- All labs passed: two-workers-no-collisions, the SKIP LOCKED contrast
  (blocking vs skipping), kill-mid-process, crash-after.
- Batch limit pinned to 1 (avoids Trap T1 — batch poisoning).
- Graceful shutdown: in-flight batch finishes via `context.WithoutCancel` +
  timeout; from the queue's point of view a graceful stop and a crash are the
  same — the tx either committed or it didn't.

### Decisions

- **Table name:** keeping `message_log` (the plan's text says `jobs`). Deferring
  the rename; Phase 4's log/queue split is the deliberate rename moment.
